1.2
===

New Features:

  * Upgrade dependencies to Servlet 2.5 and JSP 2.1.  Java 5 has been required
    since JAMWiki 0.8, so this change should be transparent to most users.
  * Add support for limited wiki text in edit summaries (wiki links, interwiki
    links) to match Mediawiki behavior.
  * Add a new JAMWiki:Header system topic that allows adding a custom message
    to the top of all pages, just below the tab bar.
  * Add a new JAMWiki:Custom.css stylesheet.  Starting with JAMWiki 1.2
    System.css will be used for base CSS styles, while Custom.css should be
    used for site-specific customizations.
  * Move the system topics (BottomArea, LeftMenu, StyleSheet) to the
    JAMWiki: namespace (JAMWiki:Footer, JAMWiki:Sidebar, JAMWiki:System.css).
  * Add an option to block malicious IP addresses that are on the Project
    Honeypot blacklist from creating accounts, editing and uploading files.
  * Support storing images directly in the database rather than on the
    filesystem (avhohlov2).
  * Store images by default in the JAMWiki file system directory, rather than
    the webapp root, to allow simpler setup and upgrades.
  * Support extensions to the JFlex parser for iframes, Facebook and Twitter.
    See http://jamwiki.org/wiki/en/Help:Tag_extensions for details.
  * Refactor caching.  The cache is now configured to use a percentage of heap
    rather than a fixed size to avoid possible OOM situations, configuration is
    now managed via the ehcache-jamwiki.xml file, and individual caches have
    been fine-tuned to optimize performance.
  * If setup finds an existing JAMWiki installation it will now prompt the user
    to restore the old configuration, and will then begin the automatic upgrade
    process if necessary.
  * Allow the table of contents to be hidden via a "show/hide" link.
  * Add support for the Mediawiki {{padleft:}} and {{padright:}} parser
    functions.  Usage: "{{padleft:string|amt|padString}}".
  * Enhance the #expr parser function to better match Mediawiki by supporting
    the order of operations and functions such as "round" and "trunc".
  * {{REVISIONMONTH}} is no longer padded ("4" instead of "04") while
    {{REVISIONMONTH1}} has been added in order to match Mediawiki behavior.
  * Allow page name and namespace magic words to specify the page to be
    operated on, instead of just the current page, to match Mediawiki behavior.
    Example: "{{PAGENAME:Template:Main Page}}".
  * Add a new ROLE_REGISTER to allow enabling/disabling self-registration for
    anonymous users.  By default anonymous users are allowed to self-register.
  * Display the last IP address used by a user on the Special:Block page when
    blocking user accounts.
  * Move hard-coded HTML to template files to allow simpler customization of
    images, table of contents, and other elements.
  * Include links via redirects on the Special:LinkTo page.
  * Move several system configuration files (jamwiki-configuration.xml, spam
    blacklist) out of the webapp root and into the JAMWiki system directory to
    make upgrading simpler.
  * Add a honeypot input during registration to deter spambots.
  * Be more strict with HTML-like tags: tags of the form "< tag>" or "< / tag>"
    are no longer supported and must be of the form "<tag>" or "</tag>".  This
    matches Mediawiki.
  * Use the JSP trimDirectiveWhitespaces directive to reduce whitespace in the
    generated HTML.
  * Deprecate TiddlyWiki import support.
  * Remove ability to automatically upgrade from versions prior to 1.0.

    compatibility.  For example, paragraphs can now start with "<".
  * Fix wiki line break ("----") to match Mediawiki by allowing four or more
    dashes as well as text on the same line as the dashes.
  * Newlines in table cells will now start a paragraph, matching Mediawiki
    behavior.
  * Allow whitespace in front of wiki table syntax (" {|") to match Mediawiki.
  * Parser directives such as "__TOC__" that are on their own lines should not
    cause paragraph insertion when parsed.
  * Allow thumbnail images to be specified using "thumnbail" in addition to
    "thumb" to match Mediawiki.
  * When a topic contains only whitespace it should be parsed to empty text and
    not display empty paragraph tags.
  * A warning should be displayed during the setup flow if an existing JAMWiki
    install is found, but was not executing properly.

    using tabs, and some options have been re-worked.
  * Store interwiki patterns in the database and add a management interface for

    default. Sites needing the old behavior (inline links) can re-enable it
    from the parser tab of the Special:Admin page.

    should only render the last caption value specified.
  * Fix a design flaw in processing of nested metadata, such as categories
    included via templates or "link to" in records in image captions, that
    could cause nested information to not be processed for the parsed topic.
  * A corrupt image should not halt page parsing; instead just display the
    image name as text.
  * Refactor image processing code to use less memory and avoid OOM errors.
  * For SVG images and other images that cannot be resized by the JVM, return
    a link to the image file rather than an upload link or error message.
  * When importing topics with Special:Import convert from Mediawiki to JAMWiki
    namespace for additional patterns including "[[:", "{{", and "{{:".
  * Fix parsing of category when the category name is a template parameter
    such as "[[Category: {{{1}}}]]".
  * Templates and signatures should be expanded when using wiki preformatted
    sytnax (" ~~~~") but not when using HTML preformatted syntax
    ("<pre>~~~~</pre>).
  * Convert all Special: pages to use proper camel case, and create redirects
    for the non-camel case versions. Reported by Michael Osipov.

    supported (+, -, /, *) and parentheses must be used to ensure that the
    order of operations is followed.
  * Support added for the {{ns:}} and {{nse:}} parser functions.
  * Support Mediawiki's {{subst:}} syntax. Usage: {{subst:template}}.
  * Support added for the __NOEDITSECTION__ behavior switch.

    and changes so that the search index is not re-optimized after every
    add/update.
  * Topic history retrieval speed improved by a factor of up to 100x for
    large data sets by adding an additional database index.
  * Search engine optimizations. Existing JAMWiki installs should rebuild
    their search index using the tools on the Special:Maintenance page.
  * "Filter results by namespace" added to Special:Allpages.

    of "Test", the link "Test:Topic" will parse as an internal link rather than
    an interwiki link.
  * Trim leading and trailing whitespace during parsing when a template is
    included to fix breakage of wiki table syntax such as "!{{Hl2}}| Word".
  * Named template parameters should also be allowed to be referenced by

  * The {{SITENAME}} magic word was not fully implemented, and returned
    "SITENAME" instead of the actual site name.
  * Links containing templates or magic words of the form "[[{{PAGENAME}}]]"
    should properly resolve the template/magic word.
  * If a namespace is not case-sensitive (user, template, category) then the
    associated comments namespace should not be case-sensitive either.
  * Interwiki links should not be rel="nofollow".
  * Links of the form "[[Help : Test]]" should link to the "Help:Test" page
    but output "Help : Test" as the link text, as per Mediawiki.

    "[[Topic|caption with http://example.com link]]".
  * Wiki pre syntax (" pre <span>HTML</span>") should allow HTML, although
    HTML pre ("<pre>pre <span>HTML</span></pre>") should not.
  * Fix an issue that caused the original image URL (instead of the resized
    image URL) to be used for syntax such as "[[Image:Example.jpg|200px]]".

    increases the maximum allowed topic size from 64kb to 16MB.
  * Fix issues where image transparency was lost after resizing.
  * Fix issue that prevented use of wiki headings within tables.
  * The Bliki parser was not included in the distribution and thus could not
